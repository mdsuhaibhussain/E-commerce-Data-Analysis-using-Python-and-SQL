# E-commerce Data Analysis using Python and SQL

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting an E-commerce Data Analysis using Python and SQL. The analysis involved preprocessing order data by handling null values, transforming data types, and creating new financial metrics. The cleaned dataset was imported into a SQL database, where complex SQL queries were crafted to uncover key business insights such as top-selling products, regional sales leaders, and year-over-year growth comparisons. Monthly sales trends were analyzed, and sub-categories with the highest profit growth were identified.

## Key Objectives

- To preprocess and clean e-commerce order data.
- To import the cleaned data into a SQL database for analysis.
- To craft complex SQL queries to uncover key business insights.
- To analyze monthly sales trends and identify high-growth sub-categories.

   - Identified sub-categories with the highest profit growth using SQL queries and Python analysis.

## Key Findings and Insights

- **Top-Selling Products:**
  - Identified the products with the highest sales volumes and revenue.

- **Regional Sales Leaders:**
  - Determined the regions with the highest sales, providing insights into geographical market performance.

- **Year-over-Year Growth:**
  - Compared sales data across different years to identify growth trends and areas of improvement.

- **Monthly Sales Trends:**
  - Analyzed monthly sales data to detect seasonal trends and patterns.

- **Profit Growth by Sub-category:**
  - Identified sub-categories that experienced the highest profit growth, providing insights for targeted marketing and inventory strategies.

## Conclusion

The E-commerce Data Analysis project provided valuable business insights through thorough data preprocessing, SQL query crafting, and trend analysis. The findings offer a comprehensive understanding of product performance, regional sales dynamics, and growth trends, aiding in strategic decision-making.
